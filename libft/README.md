# libft42

This repo contains the very first project of 42 School's common core. If you're a 42 student and you're passing by, don't hesitate to take a look but don't copy paste it (as you would lose the opportunity to learn and may reproduce some of my code's flaws).

It also contains versions of the two following projects: get_next_line and ft_printf. The same disclaimer applies.
